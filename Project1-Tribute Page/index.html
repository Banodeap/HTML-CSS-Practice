                <h2>Captain Cool</h2>
                <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni  born 7 July 1981, commonly known as MS
                    Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats
                    from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014, who plays as a Wicket-keeper-Batsman. He is
                    also the current captain of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League. Under his captaincy,
                    India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions
                    Trophy, the most by any captain. He also led India to victory in the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cup.
                    Additionally, under his leadership, India won the 2010 and 2011 ICC Test Mace and 2013 ICC ODI
                    Championship. He has scored 17,266 runs in International Cricket (including 10,000 plus runs in ODI
                    Internationals). Dhoni is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman known for his calm captaincy and his
                    ability to finish matches in tight situations for these reasons he is considered one of the best
                    finishers in the game ever, as well as one of the greatest wicket-keepers and captains in the
                    history of cricket.Dhoni demonstrated all that was right with the new middle-class India. He didn't respect reputations, but never disrespected either. He improvised, he learned, but didn't apologise for his batting style, which was not the most elegant. He became a multi-faceted ODI batsman, one who could accumulate, one who could rebuild, and one who could still unleash those big sixes.</p>
